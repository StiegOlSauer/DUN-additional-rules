# Dungeon Universalis Adventure RPG supplement
---

## Purpose of this supplement

Dungeon Universalis has one of the best implementation of dungeon mechanics and supports many ways to play. There's even a foundation for an RPG mode in the game's rulebook. However, provided additional rules are not sufficient to start playing your favorite RPG adventure right away - there's still a lot of missing parts left for players to fill by adapting or creating new rules.

Of course, for parties interested in RPG-focused gameplay there's a lot of TTRPGs on the market, but what if your party likes the dungeon crawling aspect of DUN, but wants slightly more adventure between dungeons than provided in the questbook?
For such cases this document provides some additional rules which are nowhere near comprehensive RPG systems, but may enable more social and adventure interactions for your party in-between dungeon sessions.

Rules provided below describe secondary skills, skill tests and slightly touch character creation and leveling. They do not touch global map related rules since they are well established in the DUN rulebook or any lore to the continent of Arasca.

## General approach and how to use this document

In general, allow players to assign whatever skills they want. 

Limitations on what skills players may create are described in "Secondary skills" chapter. 

Then check "Character creation" article, so players know how they assign skills during player creation. 

Then generalize skills using the technique described in "Skill assignment".

Prepare tests according to "Skill tests" chapter.

## Terminology

Before diving into skills and tests, here is short glossary of new terms that you will find in the below rules.

**Combat** - any combat-related rules and mechanics including rolls, modifiers and modes described in the DUN rulebook

**Dungeon [gameplay/skills/experience]** - rules and mechanics related to venturing through a quest or random encounter map

**Adventure [gameplay/skills/experience]** - this includes interactions on a continent map and role-playing encounters

**Game master** - Dark Player himself or DP conductor who hosts the adventure and has the final vote. Will be referred as GM.

## Secondary skills

As described in "RPG mode" chapter of DUN rules, when playing that mode, *secondary skills* could be assigned to a character. Players use their imagination and their characters' lore to create the skills to their liking, so there's no list of available pre-defined skills, it is all up to characters and GM. What is a secondary skill and how does it work will be described in detail in below articles.

During creation and further character development player may choose to assign any skill they've created to a character only if all of the following conditions are met:

- The skill does not conflict with the Dungeon Universalis rules

- The skill must **not** modify or add any *Combat* mechanics. Combat is excellently handled in DUN rules, so secondary skill must be **non-combat only**

- The skill shall have a progression starting from +1 when acquired to +5 as a maximum level

- Origin of the skill could be described by the character's lore (which essentially means that the skill should not contradict with the game/campaign/character's race and class lores)

- The skill can modify *Dungeon* mechanics, and if it does so, it must be very particular regarding its effect and its scope should be narrowed to a single function (i.e. "Lockpicking", but not "Some Mastery that includes lockpicking, trap disarming and so on"). GM shall carefully consider such skills and may not allow a skill that may break balance.

As mentioned above, there could be *Dungeon* secondary skills which synergize with dungeon mechanics and thus could be used there. The other type is *Adventure* secondary skills which are intended to use in social interactions and during continent map travel. This division is important since two types of skills use different Experience pools for development.

### Character creation

During character creation player may spend one development point in order to assign one *dungeon* skill. Player may assign or develop up to two *adventure* skills "for free" (*Example: assigning "Painting" and developing this skill to +2 is free during player creation*). Spending an additional development point allows player to assign or develop 2 *adventure* skills.

To assign a skill player declares its title, describes how it is applied and why their character have this skill in possession. Then skill is checked against limitations described above and if no contradictions found it is then written on a character sheet.

The following rules are applied during character creation:

- players may assign up to three secondary skills in total for each character

- maximum value for any secondary skill is +2

- if adventure allows creating more experienced characters, add another "free" *adventure* skill per 5 VP of created character. Increase maximum skill amount by 1 per 10 VP. Increase maximum skill value limitation per 15 VP.

*Example: adventure allows player to choose pre-defined character of 30 VP. This character then may possess up to 5 secondary skills in total, gains 6 "free" adventure skill development points and maximum secondary skill value is lifted to +3.*

### Skill generalization

Since all skills are coming from the imagination of players and could be literally anything, there is a system that generalizes them for convenient application during adventure.

As an example, player assigns a skill "Painting" to their character. This is an *adventure* skill since it does not affect DUN rules applicable in dungeons. Then it is generalized by the following criteria:

- By skill domain, which is broad area of application determined for a particular skill. Skill domain reflects gaining life experience in a broader area during learning a skill, thus enabling cross-skill tests (see *Skill tests* article below). You may invent your own or use one from an RPG system of your preference. Write the domain below the skill title. This generalization **is** mandatory.

	Example: for "Painting" you may use "Art" domain. Education of a painter gives them abilities of creating an art, but also detecting forgeries or evaluating different art pieces

- By related character attribute on which skill relies on. It is needed to aid in tests and determine development limitations as follows: 

	- maximum level of skill development should not exceed its related attribute value - 1

	- skill could be assigned only if related attribute value is equal or greater its baseline value (0 for dex/perception, 3 for all other attributes)

  For "Painting" it will be character's intelligence, write that below skill title. If it is equal or higher than 3, skill could be assigned. This generalization **is** mandatory.

- By skill tags, where each tag describes more narrow area of skill application. Might be used for distinction between skills that use similar domains/attributes, but cannot replace each other in tests. This is needed for cross-skill tests (see *Skill tests* article below), but is **not** mandatory.

	Example 1: to make a distinction between a rider who practiced with traveling circus and trained knight, their "Horse riding" skills (both of "Riding" domain with "Agility" as a related attribute) should be tagged with own distinct tags thus allowing them both ride a horse and pass the tests, but with some penalties when tested outside of skill's application area.

	Example 2: "Sculpting" and "Wood carving" skills are both of Art domain with related attribute "Dexterity", but to express that these two skills have different applications and could not replace each other.

Each skill is also attributed with the following implicit parameters:

- type of application: some skill may allow to interact with items and their lore (like "Art Collecting" or "History"), while others additionally allow to create items (like "Painting" or "Blacksmithing"). Usually this is not important, but there might be scenarios considering this.

- mastery: for values below +3 skill bearer is considered amateur. For +3 and higher - recognizable professional or master. This might be useful in design of adventures' scenes and tests (i.e. famous art collector may now want to buy a painting from an artist they do not recognize)

## Skill tests

In general, skills are tested as described in "RPG mode" chapter of a rulebook, however due to much wider range of scenarios requiring tests, there are some additional rules to consider like *complexity levels* and *cross-skill tests* described below.

To make a skill test:

* complexity of test is determined and announced by GM

* if challenge is accepted, player rolls 2d6

* player adds a modifier of a tested skill (if character didn't develop a tested skill, see *Testing of non-developed skill*)

* consider penalties if cross-skill test is performed (see *Cross-skill tests*)

* test is passed if result is equal or higher than pass value of complexity level; Determine consequences considering *critical and partial success* (see below)

### Complexity levels

To allow GMs implementation of tasks with varied difficulty and to ease porting of adventures from other systems, different test complexity levels are introduced as follows:

| Complexity level | Pass value |
|------------------|:----------:|
| Simple           |      9     |
| Regular          |     10     |
| Hard             |     11     |
| Very hard        |     12     |
| Near impossible  |     13     |

GM may either directly announce the complexity before players are opted for a test or give some adventure lore related clues on how difficult is the task.

### Attribute tests

Character attributes may also be tested. However, the attributes (except Dexterity and Perception) are usually more developed than skills, especially at the beginning of an adventure. Therefore, for all attributes except Dexterity and Perception there's a different scale of complexity. 

| Complexity level | Pass value |
|------------------|:----------:|
| Simple           |     11     |
| Regular          |     12     |
| Hard             |     13     |
| Very hard        |     14     |
| Near impossible  |     15     |

Aforementioned Dex. and Perc. attributes use the same complexity table as skills.

### Critical and partial success (and failure)

Every 6 or 1 rolled on a dice during test roll has a special meaning for GM. Double 6's do not trigger instant success (it is still required that test result is equal or exceed test pass value), but indicates that positive effects for tested character are maximized in case of successful test and minimized in case of test failure. Here's handy table:

|             Result             |                                 Test succeeded                                 |                                Test failed                               |
|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Significant success (double 6) |                  Positive effects are substantially increased                  |             There are very little repercussions of a failure             |
| Partial success (single 6)     |                  Positive effects are slightly more expressed                  |                 Some major negative effect is not applied                |
| Neutral result (6 and 1)       |                        Usual effect of a successful test                       |                       Usual effect of a failed test                      |
| Partial failure (single 1)     |              Benefits of a successful test are slightly decreased              |                     More negative effects are applied                    |
| Significant failure (double 1) | One or more major negative effects are applied  the same as in case of failure | All negative effects are applied, result cannot be re-rolled via Fortune |
