# Dungeon Universalis Adventures and RPG supplement (DUNRPG)
---

## Target audience and purpose of this supplement

Dungeon Universalis has one of the best implementations of dungeon crawling mechanics and supports many ways to play. There's even a foundation for an RPG mode in the game's rulebook. However, provided rules are not sufficient to start playing your favorite RPG adventure right away — there's still a lot of blank spaces requiring adaptation or creation of new rules.

Of course, for parties interested in RPG-focused gameplay there's a lot of TTRPGs on the market, but what if your party likes the dungeon crawling aspect of DUN, but wants to develop their characters beyond the dungeons and participate in adventures outside?

For such cases this document provides additional rules and guidance which do not compete with comprehensive RPG systems, but builds foundation for social and adventure interactions for your party in-between dungeon sessions. So the general aim of this ruleset is to allow you and your party to:

	1. Develop your characters with almost any skills imaginable and integrate them into adventure

	2. Participate in off-the-dungeon scenes, invent new approaches to any quest including social and many other types of interactions

	3. Adapt adventures created for various TTRPGs and play them in DUN style

Rules provided below describe secondary skills, skill challenges, character creation and development, magic system for non-dungeon adventures. They do not alter global map related rules or any lore of the continent of Arasca since they are well established in the DUN materials.

## General approach and how to use this document

Generally this ruleset aims to be less restrictive but retain the original DUN code within added mechanics. For example, it allows players to obtain almost any applied/social/adventure skill they may imagine for their characters.

Game mechanics described in the main part of the supplement are integrated into each other and expected to be used together. At the end of the document there is a collection of houserules which could be enabled individually as optional modules.

New rules begin at the *Secondary Skills* chapter — it describes the core of the system — role of skills in adventure encounters, creating and assigning new skills and improving them. New elements and limitation regarding character creation are also discussed there.

The next chapter is dedicated to Skill Challenges. It covers all aspects of testing newly obtained skills in different situations, also helping from others and difficulty gradation.

The last chapter among ones dedicated to game mechanics is about magic in adventure encounters. It is a new system that aims to improve gameplay for spellcasters in non-combat encounters but could be used in dungeons too.

And the final chapter of the supplement aims to help in adapting adventures from other TTRPGs for DUNRPG gameplay.

### Key Terms

Before diving into rules themselves, here is short glossary of new terms that you will find in the below rules.

**Combat** — the existing DUN combat subsystem (attributes, actions, modifiers) used without change as described in the DUN rulebook.

**Dungeon gameplay** — rules and mechanics related to venturing through a quest (in DUN terms) or random encounter map

**Adventure [gameplay/skills/experience]** — interactions in non-combat encounters and on a continent map

**Game master** - Dark Player himself or DP conductor who hosts the adventure and has the final vote. Will be referred as GM.

## How it is played

Elf-forester Taeral and catfolk-assassin Aki find themselves cornered in a hall 15 feet underground in an ancient burial mound. They stand nervously in front of heavy, weathered, metal-reinforced doors, surrounded by 2 capable Orc fighters and a fearsome warlord who apparently tracked their little endeavor in hope to get his hands on whatever treasures lie behind the doors.

"You’re getting us all killed," — shouts Aki urgently, mustering her courage to persuade the warlord. — "It won’t work that way!"

A roughly made altar-like table escalates from the stone floor of the mound hall with two round holes size of medal are blackening in the altar lid. The warlord is about to start smashing it with a warhammer, but that is going to be a big mistake — Taeral had previously sensed residual magic emanating from the altar. His knowledge allowed him to conclude that thing is opened only by feeding it with enchanted coins dating the time this mound was built. For other things it would be a trap which Aki detected as the well hidden trapdoors in the ceiling.

"Of course it will!" — Orc makes a good swing — "It always does."

The sound of an impact reflected from stone walls of a hall was so loud even the Orc fighters instinctively shudder. But while echo was still in the air, the trapdoor in the ceiling opened freeing a torrent of sand on the altar and the warlord. When dust started to settle, he seemed more surprised than hurt:

"Ha! Just handful of sand and dust? They didn't build it to last, did they?" — shouted the Orc trying to instill courage in his shaken subordinates.

"It is not a sand" — noted Taeral covering nose and mouth with his palm — "It's an ash. And it starts moving!"

Piles of ash started trembling, crackling and raising clouds of dust into the air immediately consuming confused warlord. Combining their efforts Aki and Taeral pushed the closest fighter into the ash cloud and bursted out of the hall. Pursued by terrifying screams they've reached the rope hanging from a patch of the sky on 15 ft. height ceiling. That is when they found they are not alone. The second Orc fighter was also good at sprinting and was about to attack. Aki was defenseless climbing the rope, and Taeral got to stop the Orc! While making his final steps to the escape, he combined the only elements came to his mind — Light and Stun — and bursted approaching fighter with a bright flash. Using the moments of confusion Taeral grabbed the rope and hurried upwards following Aki.

Hours later on the road to the town of Verneck adventurers were planning their next step. Fortunately for them a high-ranked merchant — distant offspring of a noble, buried in that mound — still lives in his family mansion in Verneck. It is time to pay him a visit.

### Role of The Dark Player (Game Master)

The Dark Player powers and responsibilities are much expanded in Adventure mode. Dark Player role is now equivalent to a Game Master in traditional TTRPGs and further in this document Dark Player and Game Master will be used as equivalents. To start playing as a Game Master prepare to:

    - **Onboard** players by communicating new possibilities and limitations, helping with creating or importing characters

    - *Prepare** or improvise an adventure suited to the party

    - **Describe** the game world to the players and how their actions change it
	
    - **Portray** NPCs (friends and adversaries) and control monsters during encounters

    - **Facilitate** the fun and be an ally for your players

There are many books dedicated to the art of Game Mastery and this document does not aim to be comprehensive guide in this domain. Recommended reading for new GMs: "Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master" by Michael E. Shea, "Mothership: Warden's Operations Manual" by Sean McCoy and to dive a bit deeper — "The Game Master’s Handbook of Proactive Roleplaying" by Jeff Ashworth.

## Charisma attribute

Dungeon Universalis set of attributes allows limited social interaction, so in order to expand gameplay possibilities an additional attribute was added to a standard set — Charisma. It represents the impression of a character or NPC on the others and is not limited to sole physical attractiveness, but also may find origins in brutality, manners, speech and any other source depending on situation and audience. It might also benefit from items like fancy costumes, jewelry or just good social standing. So even not very smart orkish barbarian could be charming when put into right context. It is up to GM to create situations around this.

Charisma is "virtual" attribute, which is not developed on its own, but calculated as an average (rounded down) of Intelligence and Courage. At any time when Charisma is required for challenge or skill reference, players may calculate it from the attributes of their characters. Charisma automatically improves with increase of Intelligence or Courage.

## Secondary Skills

As described in "RPG mode" chapter of DUN rules, when playing that mode, *secondary skills* could be assigned to a character. Players use their imagination and their characters' lore to create the skills to their liking, so there's no list of available pre-defined skills, it is all up to players and GM. What is a secondary skill and how does it work will be described in detail in below articles.

### Note for GM: design intentions

The system encourages players to use very specialized skills with concrete field of application, so the ability to write broad variety of abilities as an in-game skill and corresponding limitations do not overwhelm players. All provided rules serve the following design intentions:

1. Encourage players to assign authentic, specialized skills for their characters making these characters more believable to achieve better role playing experience

2. Narrow specialization of skills encourages players to search solutions that involve stronger sides of their characters

### Skills and Skill Domains

*Secondary skill* describes the particular, very specialized set of practical, active abilities of a game character gained via profession, hobby, life experience or innate finesse. In this supplement *Secondary skills* do not cover combat applications and should be tied only to non-combat behaviors. 

Almost any non‑combat ability can be represented as a Secondary Skill. But truly useful and suitable skill should be continuation of character lore and reflect its life experience in the world.

Skill mastery also has numeric representation: from 0 of *Untrained* skill to 3, possessor of which is considered a world-class Master in the field of application. 1 is considered *Trained* and 2 — *Professional* skills.

Each Skill is tied to one of the character's attributes signifying that it contributes the most in the skill development and application.

*Secondary skills* are closely tied to *Skill Domains*. Each Domain represents a broad field of abilities and describes the knowledge of character about the different aspects of the world. Domain usually links to a several skills in this sense acting as a category for them. Degree and completeness of Domain knowledge is expressed by numerical value for each Domain ranging from 0 to 3. This way, it contributes in skill challenges character may face during adventures.

Relationships between Domains and Skills could be illustrated by the following examples:

	crafting (domain):
		- woodcarving (skill)

	building:
		- carpentry (intelligence)

	athletics:
		- climbing (agility)
		- mountaineering (strength)

List of *Skill Domains* provided below is not comprehensive and is meant to be expanded for needs of particular adventure, Game Master or party, but it could be a good starting point for choosing direction of your characters' development:

|                         |                    |                       |             |                       |
|:-----------------------:|:------------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------:|:---------------------:|
|        Athletics        |     Performing     |        Crafting       |  Bushcraft  |       Occultism       |
|        Acrobatics       |      Diplomacy     |        Building       | Nature Lore |        Alchemy        |
|         Stealth         |      Bartering     |      Engineering      |   Farming   |     Lore of Magic    |
| Spotting and Perceiving |       Empathy      |        Medicine       |             |      Mythic Lore      |
|                         | Tricks and Focuses |        Thievery       |             | Religions and Deities |
|                         |                    |        Writing        |             |                       |
|                         |                    |        Artistry       |             |                       |
|                         |                    | Sciences (individual) |             |                       |



### Assigning skills during character creation

Obtaining of *Secondary Skills* occurs during creation of new or importing pre-defined character after the character got DUN skill cards.

Each Skill is originates from one of character non-combat attributes which may have slightly different meaning in DUNRPG:

	**Movement** is a speed, reaction and reflexes of a character
	
	**Strength** —  physical might and raw muscle power
	
	**Agility** — motor skills and body control in motion
	
	**Intelligence** — mental acuity, reasoning, memory and intellectual resourcefulness
	
	**Courage** — discipline, valor, control over emotions
	
	**Charisma** — communication, improvisation, empathy and strength of personality
	
	**Perception** — reading and interpreting signs by which world communicates with those who listen
	
	**Dexterity** — sleight of hand, fine motor control

Assigning of Secondary Skills is based on a character attributes. For each attribute, a character gains amount of *Secondary Skill Points* equal to:

	* for Dexterity and Perception: attribute value plus 1
	
	* for other: attribute value minus 2 (in other words, one *Secondary Skill Point* per each attribute value point higher or equal than 3)

Then, Secondary Skill Points could be spent on assigning or improving **only** those Secondary Skills based on this attribute. Initially all Secondary Skills are assigned with mastery of 1, but player may spend Secondary Skill Points on improving mastery of a single skill to 2 during character creation (see *limitations* below).

In addition to Skills assigned via Secondary Skill Points, spellcaster characters receive a Skill representing magic lore they have learned with mastery 1. Spellcasters also shall add Arcane (or any other magic-related) Domain to their sheet since all experience gained for actions performed with their magic lore could be used to improve skills in Arcane Domain.

#### Creating skills

To create a new skill, player improvises it by answering the following questions:

	1. Which abilities it gives to a character? How can the character actively apply them?
	
	2. How did the character get this Skill?
	
	3. How could it be improved? If the final improvement requires a Masterwork, what could it be?
	
	4. What character attribute is bound to a Skill?
	
Answers on these questions are communicated to the Game Master and corrections are discussed. On a Game Master's side there is a list of conditions that must be met for a *Secondary Skill* to find its way to the character sheet:

	- The Skill represents character's action and has specific practical application

	- The Skill does not conflict with the Dungeon Universalis rules

	- The Skill does **not** modify or add any *Combat* mechanics, so secondary skill must be **non-combat only**

	- Origin of the Skill fits the character's lore and does not contradict with the game or campaign lore

	- If the Skill modifies *Dungeon* mechanics, it must be very particular regarding its effect and its scope should be as narrow as possible

Game Master has the final word and when approval is granted, *Skill Domain* of new creation is determined by the Game Master, mastery level is calculated for both Domain and Skill and player writes it to a character sheet in the following form:

	```
	<Domain>:   <mastery level of a Domain>
		<Skill>(attribute) <mastery level of a Skill>
	```

#### Starting skills limitations

The following limitations should be considered during character creation:

	* Secondary Skill Points gained from an attribute could be used only to assign or improve a Secondary Skill based on this attribute
	
	* Assigning of new Secondary Skill (with mastery 1) costs 1 point, improving to 2 costs **additional** 2 points
	
	* Only one Secondary Skill could be improved to 2, its bound attribute value must be higher than 3
	
	* Maximum amount of Secondary Skills assigned is 5, but characters whose origin implies constant learning of different skills may assign up to 7 upon Game Master decision (Magic lore skills for spellcasters do not count)
	
	* Spellcasters' magic lore skills could not be improved during character creation since these skills have own improvement path described in *Adventure magic system* chapter, but experience achieved with these skills could be used in Arcane (or any other magic-related) Skill Domain as usual
	
	* If game allows players to create more developed characters than usual, then characters may have one additional Secondary Skill per 5 VP above 10 VP and improve one additional skill per 10 VP above 10 VP spending usual amount of Secondary Skill Points

*Example: A player brings pre-generated character Taeral to the adventure and in addition to character possessions from its card, is about to assign 5 Secondary Skills by distributing Skill Points obtained from attributes:

	- Movement score of 5 = 3 secondary skill points
	
	- Strength (3) = 1 secondary skill point
	
	- Agility (4) = 2 secondary skill points
	
	- Intelligence (5) = 3 secondary skill points
	
	- Courage (4) = 2 secondary skill points
	
	- Charisma (4) = 2 secondary skill points
	
	- Dexterity (0) = 1 secondary skill point
	
	- Perception (1) = 2 secondary skill points

This scores allow Taeral to create Movement or Intelligence based professional skill with mastery of 2. Additionally, Taeral gets Channeling magic lore skill for free for spellcasting abilities defined in his background. After conversation with the Game Master Taeral notes the following in the character sheet:

```
Athletics            0
	Climbing (agi)	 1

Bushcraft            0
	Camping (int)	 2

Spotting             0 
	Tracking (perc)  1

Stealth              0
	Sneaking (mov)	 2

Arcane               0

Magic Lore           0
	Light (int)      1

Nature                     0
	Beast Taming (courage) 1
```*

### Skill mastery and Domain knowledge improvement

Domains and Skills masteries are independent from each other and are improved differently.

Domain benefits from widening and deepening its scope of knowledge. domain knowledge automatically improves between adventuring sessions when sum of skill masteries within the domain reaches 3, 7 and 11 points to achieve 1, 2 and 3 level of mastery accordingly. Each level of mastery replaces modifier from the previous level. Third level of mastery is final.

Characters can improve mastery of already assigned skills and assigning new ones at the cost of *Adventure Experience Points* (abbreviated as **AXP**). This is a special type of experience granted in adventure sessions which could be used only for developing Secondary Skills.

At the end of adventuring session Game Master asks party a set of questions regarding their characters' actions and experience. Each justified positive answer grants one AXP to a character who gave this answer. If the question was related to a particular Skill, player marks a Domain of this skill on a character sheet. When all questions answered, player may convert three AXP to a Secondary Skill Point as many times as they want. The remaining AXP is noted on a character sheet and carried between sessions.

Additionally, Game Master may grant Secondary Skill Points to characters for significant achievements, usage of special items or for any other reason per GM discretion.

#### Improving assigned skill

If Domain of a Secondary Skill was marked as an answer to one of after session questions, any skills of that Domain are eligible for improvement. Advancing of the Skill mastery costs several Secondary Skill Points and requires certain value of an attribute bound to a Skill:

	- from 1st level of mastery to 2nd the cost is 2 points, requires attribute value of 4+
	
	- from 2nd level of mastery to 3rd - 3 points, requires attribute value 5+
	
Achieving 3rd level of mastery may require a Masterwork in addition to spending Secondary Skill Points if Game Master decides so, but that should be communicated beforehand. Masterwork may take a multitude of forms, some examples are:

	* an item of significance created with the help of the Skill
	
	* achievement of a personal goal, related to the Skill
	
	* notable deed that benefited character or the party 

When pre-requisites are fulfilled and Secondary Skill Points are spent, character must pass an Intelligence test with Difficulty level of **7 + desired mastery value** of a Skill (Tests are described in further chapters). Domain knowledge decreases the Difficulty, help from other characters or NPCs and usage of any useful assets are allowed. Re-rolls via Fortune points are not allowed, so the character has only one attempt for each Skill they aim to improve.

If test is passed new mastery level of a Skill is noted on a character sheet. Domain knowledge could also be improved if requirements are met after gaining a Skill mastery. In case of test failure, Skill should be marked on a character sheet, so after the next session, player must make an another attempt of improving it for free (without spending Secondary Skill Points).

When all improvement attempts are made and results noted on a character sheet, all markings from Skill Domains should be erased. Only skills which improvement attempts have failed may carry individual marks between sessions.

#### Assigning new skill

Characters may spend Secondary Skill Points on assigning new Skill to existing or new Domain. After creating a Skill as described in a previous chapter, character must pass an Intelligence test with Difficulty of **7 + 1** (counting for mastery level of a new Skill). Domain knowledge decreases the Difficulty, help from other characters or NPCs and usage of any useful assets are allowed. Re-rolls via Fortune points are not allowed. Character may assign only one Skill and have a single attempt to do so.

In case of successful test, new Skill and new Domain are noted on a character sheet. New Skill is assigned with mastery level 1, it could be further improved only after next session. If test was failed, Secondary Skill Point must be converted back to AXP which cannot be used for other improvements until next session.

#### After session questionnaire

Game Master combines 4-6 questions from both lists after each session. Game Master holds the final word regarding each character achievements, but is generally advised to be permissive.

List of General questions:

	1. Did you participate in the game session?
	
	2. Did you make progress towards your character's personal long-term goals or ambitions?
	
	3. Did you make a world-changing decision (significantly affected PC or NPC, changed the course of events, left a mark in an adventure world)?

List of skill-related questions:

	1. Did your skill help to achieve non-combat solution for combat situation?
	
	2. Did your skill provide an advantage during exploration of a new location?
	
	3. Did your skill open new possibilities for you or the party via social interaction?
	
	4. Did your skill save, heal, or significantly assist another character or NPC?
	
	5. Did you creatively apply your skill in an unexpected or unconventional way for noticeable positive outcome?
	
	6. Did your skill positively influence wealth, resources or standing of your character or the party?
	
#### Example of after-session play

The Party has finished the session and summing up their adventures with the Game Master:

GM: Let me ask you some questions, if you can answer positively, you may add 1 AXP to your character sheets. For starter, everyone who participated (all of you) add 1 AXP. Then, each of you: did you progress towards your personal goal?

Taeral: As you know I am hunting for an artifact that was stolen from a grove where I grew up. Today we found that it was definitely not hidden in a mound. Does this count?

GM: Considering that it was your lead and you traveled to the mound specifically to check it — yes. You may mark any Domain of yours to upgrade and add 1 AXP. Next is: did you make any decisions that notably affected the world?

Taeral: I guess, not. We could if we've opened a mound.

GM: I agree. Next questions will be related to skills. Were you able to resolve almost combat situation without fighting with the help of your skills?

Aki: We failed to persuade the warlord.

Taeral: I've used my magic to stop the orc fighter.

GM: That was great move, but I'd say we need bigger achievement and that was already in combat. Next one: have your skills help you during exploration?

Aki: Absolutely did, I've found a trap and we used it to get rid of the warlord.

Taeral: Detecting magic helped us with understanding the altar.

GM: That was good idea to check it for arcane residuals. Aki, you're receiving one AXP each and you may mark the Domain which Skill allowed you to detect the trap — it is Thievery I think. Taeral, also add one AXP and you have used Light magic skill, Domain of which is ruled separately, so you may mark Arcane domain.

Taeral: And that is the third AXP I have, so I use them to receive a skill point and add new skill to Arcane.

GM: What is on your mind?

Taeral: Sense magic. I'd like to develop techniques of detecting magic in the environment.

GM: I approve this one, you start with mastery of 1 and domain knowledge on 0 since this is the first skill you have in this domain.


## Challenges

When the result of character's actions is uncertain and stakes are high, whether be it a social interaction or locked chest, it is time for Game Master to challenge the characters. Answering such challenges is the main application of Secondary Skills described in previous chapters. Challenge is an *interaction* between the character and the game world (impersonated by the Game Master) which puts character's skills at test.

### Difficulty levels

Challenge **Difficulty** represents how complex is the task for untrained average person without special tools. Tasks with particularly high Difficulty Levels are made intentionally impossible for such person.

| Level |    Difficulty    | Pass value | Dex/Perc value requirement | Success probability (%) |
|:-----:|:----------------:|------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
|   1   |      Trivial     |  Autopass  |             -     	     |		    -			   |
|	2	|	   Simple	   |	  6		|		     -1				 |		   73			   |
|	3	|	   Regular	   |	  7		|		     -1				 |		   59			   |
|	4	|	   Moderate	   |	  8		|		     -1				 |		   42			   |
|	5	|	   Complex	   |	  9		|		      0				 |		   28			   |
|	6	|		Hard	   |	 10		|		      0				 |		   17			   |
|	7	|	  Very hard	   |	 11		|		      0				 |		    9			   |
|	8	|	 Intimidating  |	 12		|		      1				 |		    3			   |
|	9	|  Near Impossible |	 13		|		      1				 |		    -			   |
|	10	|		Insane	   |	 14		|		      2				 |		    -			   |
|	11	|	  Impossible   |	 15		|		      2				 |		    -			   |

*Level* column represents numerical expression of a task complexity and also has other meanings which will be described later.

*Difficulty* describes how hard it is to succeed in such challenge for an average person. 

*Pass value* holds the result of 2d6 roll (sum of dice values of two d6 dice rolled) required to succeed in the challenge and *Success probability* is the probability of rolling such value on unmodified 2d6.

*Dex/Perc value requirement* shows the value of Dex or Perception attributes required for attempting a challenge of corresponding Difficulty without penalties or bonuses.

### Creating new challenge

New challenge appears when characters act in unpredictable environment lacking skills, plan, tools or time, or facing opposition to their actions. Not every action needs a dice roll, but Game Master shall be prepared with some pre-designed situations and readiness for improvisation. Game Master is encouraged to include challenging situations in dungeon and non-dungeon adventures.

While preparing or improvising a challenging situation, Game Master should be familiar with core elements of any challenge described below.

#### An obstacle

Each challenge revolves around an obstacle which could be passed by one or several ways. This obstacle is usually described by a Game Master and players propose solutions often including application of different Skills and approaches. That is why in the most of the cases there is no need to pre-define Skill/Domain required for completing a challenge. But the obstacle should be clearly presented to players.

Some actions may present challenges for a specific attribute, like lifting a log or busting through stuck door, but it is advised to challenge characters' Secondary Skills whenever possible. Skills and attributes have different scale gradation, so tuning Difficulty for both might be tricky. Most of the time simple actions that would test the attribute could be resolved with no challenge at all.

#### Difficulty

The core of each challenge is its Difficulty, which is usually shifted by different factors. When planning the initial Difficulty of a challenge, consider the following:

	* Importance for characters and for forces opposing them. If characters are opposed by actors, how well these actors prepared for an encounter

	* Consequences of success and failure

	* Non-situational opposing factors that are integral for the challenge

		*Example of such factor: rocks are always sharp regardless to a degree of character's preparations"

Game Master shall communicate Difficulty directly or narratively before players committed to the challenge. Then players and GM discuss factors that affect Difficulty, Skills and attributes used, potential consequences of success and failure. 

Characters may decrease the Difficulty by applying Skill masteries, proper tools and various tricks:

	* Skill mastery decreases Difficulty by its value
	
	* Domain knowledge decreases Difficulty by its value
	
	* If none of the above applied, then Difficulty is decreased one step if challenged attribute is *particularly high*

	* Any trick that GM deems effective for improving character's odds

Harsh environment, time constraints and other situational negative factors may raise the Difficulty above planned:

	* If character possesses neither tested Skill nor Domain, then Difficulty is increased one step if challenged attribute is *particularly low*

	* Different unplanned situational factors

Attribute is considered **particularly high or low** if it is higher or lower than *Difficulty level* of the challenge For Dexterity or Perception attributes use the value from *Dex/Perc value requirement* column instead of Difficulty level.

To decrease or increase Difficulty for some value add or subtract this value from Difficulty Level. When several factors shift Difficulty both sides, increases are applied first then followed by decreases. New Difficulty parameters after applying all modifiers are called the **Final Difficulty**.

If the Challenge Difficulty was decreased to Trivial, then test is passed automatically. Roll still might be needed to determine critical effects that correspond to the success, but is left at GM discretion.

| Difficulty of the test is decreased by... |       Difficulty of the test is increased by...       |
|:-----------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------:|
|           Domain knowledge value          | Tested Attribute value is lower than test difficulty* |
|                Skill value                |                Harsh conditions                       |
|     Particularly high attribute value*    |               Time restrictions                       |
|             Tools and tricks              |           Other situational factors                   |

* *Special rules apply*

*Example: The Zombie character tries to get into a fortress of their Evil Master, but is stopped by a reinforced door. A voice from behind the door asks for a password, which Zombie does not know. Zombie tries to guess the password and Game Master announces quick Deduction (domain: Investigation; attr: Intelligence) challenge of Regular difficulty (because the password is "evilmaster666"). Since Zombie does not have this skill mastery or domain knowledge in possession, Zombie can rely only on Intelligence attribute and do a brainz-storming. Considering an intelligence of 1, GM increases challenge difficulty one step to Moderate since according to Difficulty Level column, Regular difficulty requires value of at least 3*

#### Type of challenge

There are three types of challenges best suitable for different situations: quick, opposed and multistage, all are described in the next chapter.

There are three challenge mechanisms fitting different situations, but all trying to be mechanically close to the original DUN as possible. GM chooses what fits the best — there are no strict rules obliging to use specific test type.

**Quick**

Best suited for relatively quick actions (picking a simple lock) or actions with no active opposition (drawing a sketch). Helping is allowed per standard rules.

After determining test's final difficulty, player rolls 2d6 and compares results with target value. If result equals or exceeds target value, challenge is passed. Critical successes and failures are interpreted using the table in the previous chapter.

**Opposing**

Suits for situations when character's action leads to a confrontation with another actor and is actively resisted. Helping is allowed for both parties per standard rules.

Difficulty of opposed tests is determined by attributes or Skills of opposing side. There is no need to determine full stats of NPC that opposes the character. Instead determine how difficult is to win the challenge for an average person consulting with the table in the previous section and use number from *Difficulty Level* column as sum of all modifiers of opposing actor.

GM rolls 2d6 + modifiers for opposing actor, player rolls 2d6 + own modifiers for character. Higher result wins. In case of a tie, the side with more 6 results on dice wins. 

**Multistage**

Ideal for situations when GM would set-up several repeating quick challenges, such as:

	* The action is lengthy and complex by its nature, requires maintaining concentration for a while and GM wants to emphasize the drama and importance of an action
	
		*Example: opening of stuck, rusty door in a dungeon full of unaware enemies; lifting and holding a heavy rock while rest of the party crawls under*
	
	* Action has multiple stages which could be individually passed or failed leading to a branching outcomes
	
		*Example: climbing to a window on the 3rd floor by a mansion wall trying not to make a noise*
	
	* Action meets some passive resistance from nature or forces without an actor
	
		*Example: moving in a storm, holding breath under water*

GM determines amount of stages for the challenge based on the length of the action and other applicable factors. Difficulty of the challenge is a number in **Level** column of Difficulty table. Player rolls amount of d6 equal to a value of character's attribute bound to a tested skill. Each d6 with a result equal or higher than **Level** of challenge Difficulty is counted towards passed stages. Each stage is evaluated individually and if the character did not pass all test stages, GM may allow to start the character's next attempt from where it was left previously. 1's and 6's may increase the effects of succeeding or failing a stage.

Help is allowed for granting automatic success or decreasing difficulty for some of the test stages — up to GM discretion.

*Example: Taeral wants to reach a balcony on a second floor of a mansion by climbing a wall while patrolling guard is looking other direction. Shara is ready to give Taeral a boost. GM announces a multi-stage Climbing (Dex) test and determines Difficulty of the test as Hard (time constraints, walls are mostly flat with little decorations that can support elf's weight) with 4 stages (jump to grab an ornament between floors, pull up to the second floor, reach balcony, vault over the railing). Fortunately, Taeral grew up in a forest where he mastered climbing to level 2 and has 1 level of Athletics domain knowledge, so the final Difficulty is reduced from Hard (6) to Regular (3), since no other factors contribute (Taeral has no suitable equipment). Taeral has agility value of 4, so he rolls 4 d6 and each result of 3+ will be considered successful. Shara's boost contributes one additional success. Dice rolled and results are 6-4-2-1 + automatic success from Shara. GM and Taeral collectively evaluate that boosted by Shara he easily covered distance to the balcony (6) and even when his hand slipped (1) from a decorative tile he did not make a noise, but upon reaching the balcony balustrade (4) the momentum was lost and he did not manage to vault over the railing (2). Taeral is left hanging from the balcony and will start the next attempt from there. He will roll 4 dice, but only one success will be needed to finish the test.*

#### Tools and ways to avoid the challenge

As rare as dungeons with the only way of walking through them, situations with unavoidable challenges should occur very seldom. Methods of bypassing the challenge or challenging situation as a whole should almost always exist and could be planned beforehand to be narratively delivered to characters. GM shall support players' creative methods of avoiding challenging situations.

Tools could also be useful for managing challenge Difficulty. Rope could help passing the obstacle, magic trick could distract a guard while rogue steals a key from their pockets and so on. GM shall keep in mind various tools that could help decreasing challenge Difficulty and support players for improvising such tools.

#### Narrative and consequences

Any challenging situation should be relevant and justified even if the situation itself is a surprise for characters. Attribute of a good challenge is a narrative describing how character's action lead to a challenge, what happened when character succeeded or failed.

Consequences of a challenge may include critical successes or failures and more often minor boons or complications which GM should be ready to improvise and communicate.

### Critical and partial success (and failure)

Every 6 or 1 rolled on a dice during test roll has a special meaning for GM. Double 6's do not trigger instant success (it is still required that test result is equal or exceed test target value), but indicates that positive effects for tested character are maximized in case of successful test and minimized in case of test failure. Here's handy table:

|             Result             |                                 Test succeeded                                     |                                Test failed                               |
|:------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Exceptional roll (double 6)    |                  Positive effects are substantially increased even with unpredictable, unusual results | There are very little repercussions of a failure, even some benefits could be granted  |
| Positive roll (single 6)       |                  Positive effects are slightly more expressed                      |                 Some major negative effect is not applied                |
| Neutral result (6 and 1)       |                        Usual effect of a successful test                           |                       Usual effect of a failed test                      |
| Complication (single 1)        |              Benefits of a successful test are slightly decreased                  |                     More negative effects are applied                    |
| Blunder (double 1)             |          Almost no distinction between this result and a failure                   | Strange, unexpected twist of negative effects strikes a character, result cannot be re-rolled via Fortune |

### Help from others

Other characters or NPCs may help challenged character if they physically present, have the capacity and qualification to support character's action. Qualification usually means that helping party possesses challenged skill or Domain knowledge not lower than 1 level of negative difference than tested character's mastery. Qualification might not be required if helping party have a good description of helping actions that do not involve challenged skill.

Help must be declared before any dice are rolled. Game Master decides how many helping PCs or NPCs are allowed to act, but it is usually limited to a single helper.

Each helper rolls one d6 simultaneously with the challenged character. Player of challenged character may use two dice with the best values as roll result. Different challenge mechanics may present additional rules for helping.

### Resolving the challenge

Use this list as a helper when resolving any challenges:

	* GM describes the challenging situation to players

	* Players discuss the situation, propose the solutions, Skills they use and tools 

	* GM narratively or directly communicates type and Difficulty of challenges, associated with players' solutions, challenged Skills, Domains, Attributes and potential outcomes for characters

	* Players discuss, ask questions, propose new solutions and iterate over previous step eventually committing or, if narratively possible, backing off from the challenge

	* Challenged character directly or narratively announces the way they resolve the challenge

	* GM calculates Final Difficulty by:

		- increasing the Difficulty due to effects of situational modifiers
		
		- increasing or decreasing the Difficulty one step if challenged attribute value is lower/higher than Difficulty Level if character does not have challenged Skill or Domain knowledge

		- decreasing the Difficulty on amount of steps equal to challenged Skill Mastery of the challenged character

		- decreasing the Difficulty on amount of steps equal to challenged Domain knowledge of the challenged character

		- decreasing the Difficulty as an effect from used tools, magic and positive situational effects

	* Player and helpers roll dice according to the type of challenge

	* GM announces challenge result and determines consequences considering critical and partial successes or failures
	
#### Example of play

A party stumbles upon a Diplomat's mansion. It is a crowded street, but just one guard is in sight, he looks tired patrolling western side of the building where balcony on the second floor peeks out on the modest garden. Eastern side does not have any features aside of two piles of building materials, closed and draped windows on the second floor and unremarkable wooden door.

Aki: Do we see anyone looking after this door?

GM: No, it doesn't seem to be an object of interest for anyone you see.

Aki: Let's go?

Shara & Taeral: We carefully approaching the door. What do we see?

GM: At close-up the door looks more interesting. Despite humble size and absence of decorations it looks heavy, made by a decent master. It has reinforced hinges and a keyhole.

Shara: If I smash it, will be a lot of noise, it could event withstand couple of blows.

Taeral: I can try climbing, but we do not see what's behind the windows — what if I barge into a ballroom full of guests?

Aki: Okay, I can lockpick. I examine the lock and look through a keyhole.

GM: That is considered a reinforced door, it could be broken, but it will resist. Aki, from outside you cannot tell much about a lock, but peeking into a keyhole makes you think that lock is decent quality. It smells oil, so it was maintained recently. Inside you see only dimly lit wall.

Aki: I carefully look around and if nobody sees me preparing to pick a lock. I have a set of lockpicks.

Shara & Taeral: We're taking positions near the piles and looking around.

GM: Okay, Aki, as you work on the lock, you understand that it will be a Very Hard challenge for you. Obviously, lockpicking skill or good dexterity would help, you seem to have one I reckon?

Aki: I am a Pro! I proceed with picking with my mastery of Lockpicking of 2. Does knowledge of Thievery domain help?

GM: Of course.

Aki: I have 2 in Thievery domain knowledge and a set of fine lockpicks with me.

GM: Great! You are in hurry, but not in rush and lock is in good condition, so your skills and tools decrease the difficulty 5 steps down! Final difficulty for you is Simple now, you need to roll just 6.

Aki: I commit! *rolls 6 and 5*

GM: In less than a minute you rake the lock open. Your 6 allows you to notice an additional detail right before lock disengages: there is an additional part inside the lock. It did not interfere with your lockpicking, so it must have a different purpose. Lock clicks and door moves inwards on well maintained hinges.

Aki: That unknown part, could it be a magic alarm?

GM: Door suddenly opens and you see a flintlock pistol looking with its pitch black bore right into your face. You are pulled inside by another creature, it all takes a mere moment till you're in and the door loudly slams behind your back.

### Challenges: notes for GM

#### Design intentions

It might be useful to know the design decisions composed the core of skill challenges rules to better see its background and possibilities:

	1. Different interactions of characters with the world should be reflected in challenge mechanisms

	2. Contribution of the skill should be higher than contribution of the roll for trained, experienced characters

	3. Test difficulty should use clear gradation for easy communication between GM and players
	
	4. Introduce new mechanics with simple application but retain familiarity with DUN rules

#### Ask to roll only when needed

The challenge itself is a resolution of situation caused by character's actions (or absence of such), so at first the Game Masters shall challenge themselves whether or not to ask players to roll the dice. In general, if characters have a good plan, good tools, skills and enough time, there's no need to roll. Such level of preparation should be rewarded.

#### Multistage challenges

Challenges of this type are most complex, but also could be the most dramatic and rewarding experience. Learn to master them and use appropriately in the most intense moments. Dramatic interpretation of rolls in multistage challenges is recommended.

## Magic and spells in Adventure encounters

### General

Any spell could be cast in any type of encounter as per original DUN rules. However, since DUN magic is mainly designed around dungeons and eliminating of enemies, spellcasters may feel slight disadvantage in adventure encounters. To overcome this, new magic mechanism is introduced **in addition** to DUN magic system. It allows a spellcaster to compose new spells from individual elements combined with each other allowing for great versatility. This approach is applicable in dungeons too with the same limitations.

### Adventure magic system

In *adventure magic* spells are not statically written or memorized recipes, but combinations of effects, combined by a spellcaster. For this purpose any existing spell in DUN could be decomposed onto its building blocks called effects. Effect is a single functional element of the spell:

	*Example 1: spell "Mind Burst" from the Lore of Mentalism consists of only one element — "damage against Intellect". However, this effect could be interpreted differently — from mild headache or clouded consciousness to unrecoverable damage to target's brain. 
	
	Spell "Water whip" from the Lore of Water contains more elements: conjure and control a body of water to physically interact with objects: push (resisted by passing a Strength test), deal damage, knock down (negated by passing a Strength test)*

Each effect could be separated from the spell, re-interpreted to the spellcaster's liking and re-used alone or in combination with other effects known to a spellcaster to make a new cast. This require memorized spells or effects and skill mastery in a magic lore.

### Magic skills

In order to extract effects from DUN spells of a particular lore of magic, a character must possess a skill mastery in this lore. Domain for magic lore masteries acts differently from other skill domains — its knowledge level cannot be improved by any means. Instead, any AXP received for this Domain allows to mark Arcane (or any other magic-related) Domain and improve skills of that Domain per usual rules.

Magic lore skills could be obtained by training with a more experienced spellcaster, but mainly by learning spells of  lore. When a character learns new magic lore (during character creation or further development) this character receives mastery of 1 of learned lore for free. If character already has a skill this lore in possession, its mastery is not improved. Learning 5 total spells of the lore improves skill mastery to 2 for free. In order to make a final improvement in skill mastery, it is required to learn a spell from the lore with Archmage requirements and spend AXP as usual.

Progression of lore skill mastery allows character:

	* Learn about new elements

	* Extract higher amount elements from any learned spell of this magic lore (equal to skill mastery)

	* Combine higher amount of elements in adventure spell (equal to 1 + highest mastery of possessed magic lore skills)

	* Detect magic effects, items, have better understanding of magic in the world
	
In addition to elements extracted from learned spells, a caster learns elements provided by magic lore skill mastery — these are called **Lore Elements**. Each level of each lore gives access to two elements applicable in adventure magic spells:

| Mastery |          Fire          |        Earth       |        Air       |       Water      |             Light            |       Blessings       |        Runic       |      Music      |
|:-------:|:----------------------:|:------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------------------:|:---------------------:|:------------------:|:---------------:|

|    2    |       Flame, Pain      |  Gravity, Restrain | Levitate, Vanish | Absorbing, Scent | Beam, Light/Color Perception |     Oath, Fortune     | Stillness, Crumble |  Melody, Artful |

|    1    |       Ash, Blood       |   Voice, Visions   |       Lust       |       Foul,      |       Blossom, Thicken       |      Mist, Effigy     |    Flow, Gather    |  Observer, Roar |
|    2    |      Leech, Cracks     | Temptation, Memory |                  |    Rot, Greed    |         Growth, Wood         | Current,Hallucination |   Core, Transmit   |                 |

### Casting adventure spells

DUN limitations (p.38) are also applied to casting of Adventure spells: one of caster's hands must be free, casting of superior (2 mana) spells cannot be combined with movement, only one permanent spell could be held at the same time.

Adventure magic spells are cast on the fly and does not have to be written. In order to cast an adventure spell character needs to:

	* Pick up to *1 + highest lore skill mastery* amount of elements (note that domain knowledge is not added to skill mastery in this case):

		- extracting from DUN spells: up to lore skill mastery per spell

		- from lore elements: no restrictions
		
		- elements could be picked from different magic Lore in any combination

	* Interpret, combine and discuss spell effect with the Game Master. GM has the final word regarding spell effects
	
	* Pass an Intelligence test and apply effect of the spell (permanent effects are applied as per DUN rules)
	
	* Remove mana markers equal to the cost of the spell:
	
		- one mana point if spell has up to two combined elements total

		- two mana points if spell has 3 or 4 combined elements total

	* Place mana marker to any DUN spell that was used to extract elements for this adventure spell

		- if adventure spell was cast using only lore elements, place marker on any spell of used Lore

In adventure encounters spells are cast as described in DUN rules, but in absence of grid, all distances could be calculated in feet or meters: 1 square = 5 ft = 2 m.

In addition to DUN rules, the following are applied to spellcasting in Adventure encounters:

	* If spell targets an arbitrary object, the *minimal* size of such object should be wieldable by a Small sized character
	
		*Example: a grain of sand is not a valid target of such spell while small apple is*

	* If an object which has active spell effects is destroyed, spell effects are also removed

	* Spellcaster may voluntarily remove the effect of a spell cast by them

## Additional supplements

### Healing potions and other medicine

Out of combat healing potions should have maximum effect in cost of full activation of a character who applies a potion. Other medicine may use related medical skill of a character in order to determine effect.

### Traps

Must be predefined, thematic and logically placed. No auto-roll on leaving safe-zone. Each character casts a safe zone at the beginning of an activation. Perception test automatically uncovers suspicious signs (which may be traps) in case of success.
