# Feat system and feat points

---

## Purpose of this document

Feat system introduced in New Challenges expansion is quite generic. Instead of making characters more skilled in particular areas where they feats are more likely to develop and giving a room for a roleplay and creation of unique background for each hero, it feels more like mechanical luck controlling mechanism. Purpose of this small ruleset is to make feat points a bit more specialized.

## Assignment

Feat points (*f.p.*) are granted to a character upon creation as per rulebook (2 for Large/invulnerable, 4 for Small, 3 for everyone else). Each feat point is then assigned to a particular character attribute (except natural armor, mana, vitality). Multiple feat points could be assigned to a same attribute if desired, distribution is noted on a character sheet, but not more than one feat point could be assigned to a dexterity and/or perception. 

For convenience of feat points accounting, assign certain color to each attribute and then either use generic colored cubes or colorize the background of one side of a fortune token, so you always have color-coded representation of unspent feat points on your character sheet.

_Example: player set red as a strength attribute color and pink for combat skill. Then they assigned one f.p to a strength and two to a combat skill, so they put one red-colored cube or fortune token and two pink ones to their character sheet also taking a note of assigned feat points._

_Optionally_ you may describe to your party the events from the character's past which lead to development of these feats.

## Usage

### Feat point conversion effect

When f.p. usage is declared, value of its effect will be equal to amount of unspent f.p. on a corresponding attribute. This effect is then applied and f.p. token is discarded. If this calculation method is used, not more than one f.p. could be spent per each usage scenario at once.

_Example: if a character has assigned 3 f.p. to their combat skill, they may use feat points in three separate combat rolls to gain +3, +2 and +1 accordingly.

### Feat point application

According to an attribute which has feat points assigned and in certain conditions listed below, player may declare usage of a single feat point from a corresponding attribute to:

1. During movement - gain movement points for a feat point spent from "Movement" attribute

    _Example: character who has invested 2 feat points in movement attribute may declare during movement that they spend a feat point to travel 2 squares more on a normal terrain. On the next turn the other spent feat point will allow them to travel 1 square more_

2. After a test or opposing roll which involved corresponding attribute - to increase roll result by spending f.p.

    _Example: a character which invested 2 f.p. into combat skill may alter own opposed melee combat roll result by +2 by spending an f.p._

3. Before damage roll if character's strength is used to calculate amount of rolled dice - increase amount of damage dice

    _Example: after successful hit but before rolling damage dice, a character may declare that they spend f.p. assigned to strength to roll more damage dice_

Feat points from one attribute cannot be used to alter results of a test/roll which uses another attribute (i.e. f.p. assigned to strength cannot be used to improve roll results of intelligence test). After application of f.p. effect, token representing spent feat point is discarded from a character sheet.

## Replenishment
Feat points are restored as per rulebook.
