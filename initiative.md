# Initiative additional rules
---

## Preface

Some parties, especially coming from similar games or TTRPGs, may prefer non-fixed initiative. This mini-ruleset aims to bring more variety to battles in dungeon rooms, but preserve the balance and elegance of Dungeon Universalis rules.

Initiative rules remain the same for sections where Champion or Leader is spawned representing their command abilities over lower ranked creatures. In other cases, creatures and characters will act according to their positions on the initiative track. This represents lower organization level of creatures without a commander. They may act in non-optimal order with reduced effectiveness. But when commanding creature is on a battlefield, minions will employ some tactics (from original DUN rules).

## New approach to initiative

### Enemy spawned in a revealed room

If there are **no** Champion or Leader creatures spawned in a newly revealed room, then standard initiative sequence from the DUN rules is **not** applied. Instead, follow the steps below.

When new room with enemies is revealed :

1. Perform opposed initiative roll as per DUN rules (character, revealed the room vs. most perceptive creature), but remember the results of character and enemy rolls for later use. Apply "Caught by surprise" and other applicable effects

2. All remaining player-controlled characters perform initiative rolls (not opposed ones, just roll 2d6, add perception modifier and all bonuses from skills, remember the result)

3. Split enemy creatures into groups of convenient size depending on particular situation and creatures composition (i.e. by creature weapon type or by bestiary cards). Then Dark Player performs an initiative roll for each group same way characters did before 

	*Example 1: if there are skeletons and zombies in the room and groups have been created based on a creature type, then perform one roll for skeleton type and one for zombie*

	*Example 2: in addition to zombie, there are skeletons with different equipment in the room - with bows and swords. DP decided to split them on three groups - zombies, melee skeletons and ranged skeletons. Then three initiative rolls are performed - one for each group*

4. Sort all gathered initiative roll results from higher to lower, so they form **the initiative track**

5. Fetch a die for every character and creature group, lay them on character and creature sheets so number on a die represents the position of the character/creature on the initiative track

6. Start combat turn:

	If the **characters** won opposed initiative roll (performed on step (1)):

	* For the first turn of combat all characters activate before creatures in the order they prefer, regardless of their position on the initiative track

	* After all characters have finished with their activations, then creatures activate in the initiative order

	* Starting from the second combat turn and till the end of the combat, characters and creatures perform their activations according to the initiative track

	If the **creatures** won opposed initiative roll:

	* Creatures and characters are activated according to their position on the initiative track till the end of the combat

### New enemy creatures appeared during combat

If Leader or Champion creature appeared on the battlefield, then all creatures shall act according to DUN rules, initiative track positions are no longer affect turn order. If there are no Leader or Champion, proceed with steps below:

1. Perform opposed initiative roll as per DUN rules for such situations, remember the results

2. Creatures that fit in existing initiative groups are added to corresponding groups, new creature groups (if any) shall roll the initiative and take their place on **the initiative track**

3. Proceed with opposed initiative roll result:

	* If **creatures** won the initiative - they are activated immediately as per DUN rules; starting from the next combat turn these creatures are activated according to their position on the initiative track

	* If **characters** won the initiative - newly appeared creatures are activated according their positions on the initiative track 

4. Proceed with activations according to the initiative track

### Optional rule - variable initiative

For even more dynamics and fluidity on the battlefield, one may add the following rule to the above ones.

If a creature is hit in combat, it decreases its initiative by one, but no more than once per round. So multiple hits in one round still lower creature's initiative by 1 total.

If a creature kills or knocks out another creature, it increases the initiative by 1. Same rule for multiple kills counting as one initiative increase is also applied here.
