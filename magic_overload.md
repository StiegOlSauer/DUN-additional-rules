## Aim of this document

To make spellcasters more badass, but at a cost...

## Rules section

### Definition

Spell overload is an ability for a spellcaster to invest more mana into casting of a spell to increase its effect at the cost of more difficult spellcasting intelligence test and dire consequences in case of a failure.

### General rules

After declaring an action for casting a spell, but before any tests are made, a character may additionally declare that they overload the spell with a paticular effect(s) (see overload effects table below). In this case Intelligence test for casting a spee is made with increased difficulty - +1 for each declared effect. In case of successful test, in addition to a mana markers spent to cast a spell itself, character also discards a mana marker if they have applied one or two effects or two mana markers if three effects are applied. Each application of an overload effect is considered as a separate overload effect (i.e. two damage overload and one range overload are still as three effects and will cost 2 additional mana). 

Overloaded effects are applied to a spell as per *Overload effects* table increasing its capabilities and then spell effects are applied as per original DUN rules.

When Intelligence test for casting a spell is failed, caster shall face the consequences of their own careless attiture to mystical powers:

	* apply 1 spell damage die vs caster Intelligence

	* if there's a critical fail (single 1 on dice roll), in addition to above discard one mana marker

	* in case of a Blunder instead of the all above, apply rules of spellcasting Blunder from original DUN rules, but adding damage dice equal to amount of mana spent on overload effects

	* if magical failures supplement is used, instead of all above determine failure type according to supplement rules and then shift up once per each applied effect

### Limitations

There are couple of important limitations to overloading spells:

1. Apprentice spellcasters may use overload only once between rests, ordinary spellcasters - two times, Archmages - three times.

2. In total, not more than 3 overload effects could be applied. Stacked effects of the same type count as separate effects.

3. Each overload effect could be applied several times with resulting effect suming up individual overload effects. However, resulting effect shall not exceed half (rounded up) of original spell effect. If it does, overload effect cannot be applied.

	*Example: spell does three damage dice to a single target. Damage overload could be applied to increase spell damage by 2, since half (rounded up) of 3 damage is exactly 2. Another damage overload cannot be applied on top of that since it will exceed that limitation.*

4. If overloaded spell effect affects several targets, then overload of this effect is not applied to all targest, but instead shall be distributed across these targets as equally as possible.

	*Example: spell does 4 damage to targets in its area of effect. Caster overloaded spell adding 2 damage and successfully casted it so there are three targets in spell's AoE. Two tagets (per caster's choice) receive 5 damage, one target receives 4, since 2 overloaded damage must be distributed.*

5. Spell cannot be overloaded with an effect it does not have initially. I.e. if spell is applied to the caster only, it cannot have overloaded with range or reach effect.

6. Enhancing spells that add damage to a weapon or other entity are not considered to be dealing damage by themselves, so cannot be overloaded with damage effect.
