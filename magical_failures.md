# Magical failures additioanl rules
---

## Preface

In DUN rules magic is an absolute blast! And if character fails critically during spellcasting, that blast goes directly in their face. However, there's only one condition of failure, which does not support the feeling of actually performing magical things. This small ruleset adds tables for critical and partical failures of spellcasting that backlash on a caster in less usual ways.

## Partial failure

If spellcaster failed Intelligence test during casting a spell and one (and just one) of dice thrown for Intelligence test shown 1, then apply any external (in context of this document) effects and roll d20 to determine the type of magical failure using the table below:

| Roll |                  Result                  |
|:----:|:----------------------------------------:|
|   1  | Apply 2 damage dice against Intelligence |
|  2-3 | Apply 1 damage dice against Intelligence |
|   4  |                                          |
|      |                                          |
|      |                                          |
